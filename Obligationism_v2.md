Do you think it is possible for someone in real life to find themselves in this **exact** situation?

1. They actively desire to not exist
2. They recognize others want them to exist
3. They care more about (2) than (1) 
4. This conflict is why they continue existing (like the sole reason)
5. This isn't due to depression or temporary feelings - it's their stable outlook

My experience asking this question so far has been that it is somewhat controversial. So instead of trying figure out the answer to this question we will simply proceed by thinking about what each answer to this would implicate.

If we start with the answer "no", what would that mean? If we imagine a person A coming up to person B. Where B don't think that this scenario is possible but A insists that they finds themselves exactly in that very scenario. How would then B rationalize this? One way would would perhaps be to simply say that A is depressed or perhaps mentally confused. Another approach would be to say that they perhaps might be in this scenario now, but that it is not impossible escape it. In other words it could be a temporal illusion.
