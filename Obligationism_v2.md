Do you think it is possible for someone in real life to find themselves in this situation?

1. They actively desire to not exist
2. They recognize others want them to exist
3. They care more about (2) than (1) 
4. This conflict is why they continue existing (like the sole reason)
5. This isn't due to depression or temporary feelings - it's their stable outlook

If the answer is "no", you can stop reading. Because then your view on someone being in this situation simply is that they are depressed/confused/delusional. That is a valid view to have on that, but that also makes the value of what a "yes" answer would mean not have any value to you.
