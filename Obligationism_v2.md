> Is it possible for someone to rationally hold a philosophical position of continuous desire for non-existence, not due to depression or temporary circumstances, but because it's their stable outlook?

My experience asking this question has been that it is controversial. So instead of trying to figure out a definite answer we will proceed by thinking about how one could explain each position.

How could person A rationalize B's claim of holding this position while still being convinced that it is impossible? From how I see it there would be four categories for this:

1. It is pathological, such as depression or other mental health conditions.
2. B has made a cognitive or logical error and is simply mistaken.
3. It is a temporary state.
4. B is not being honest about their true preferences
