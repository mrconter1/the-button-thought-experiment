Let us investigate the following question:

> Do you think that it is possible for someone to rationally personally hold a philosophical position of continous desire of non-existence, not due to depression or temporary feelings, but because it's their stable outlook?

My experience asking this question so far has been that it is somewhat controversial. So instead of trying to figure out the real answer we will simply proceed by thinking about how one could explain each position.

How could person A rationalize B's claim of holding this position while still being convinced that it is impossible? From how I see it there would mainly be four categories for this:

1. It is pathological, such as depression or other mental health conditions.
2. B has made a cognitive or logical error and is simply mistaken.
3. It is a temporary state.
4. B is not being honest about their true preferences
