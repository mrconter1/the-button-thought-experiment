Imagine we meet someone who finds themselves in this situation:

> 1. They actively desire to not exist
> 2. They recognize others want them to exist
> 3. They care more about (2) than (1) 
> 4. This conflict is why they continue existing
> 5. This isn't due to depression or temporary feelings - it's their stable outlook

I'm curious about two things:

> 1. Do you think this is a real situation someone could find themselves in?
