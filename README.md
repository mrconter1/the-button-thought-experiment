# The Button Thought Experiment

If you had a button, that when pressed, caused you to instantly and painlessly disappear. While also not affecting anyone or the universe around your now or in the future in any way. Would you press that?

Most people likely wouldn't. But out of the people that would press it, what kind of reasons could it be? One obvious reason would be if you were in great pain, either physically or mentally. Another reason could be due to impulsiveness. You miss your buss on the way to work for instance.

Now... This kind of scenario is of course not possible. No human can disappear without affecting the universe trajectory in any way. And even if it was possible, that in itself raises issues. How would that work? If you for instance was replaced by a robot indistinguishable from you, how could you not still have moral responsibly from what that does?

But if we disregard those aspects and simply say that it was possible. Can we imagine a person who would press it that isn't depressed, isn't acting on impulse and generally has a relatively comfortable life?

There are obviously people who do the equivalent of pressing the button even though they are aware of the consequences of their actions. Many of those people traumatize the people that has the bad luck of being involved directly in the very act and they often traumatize even more people long-term.

And there doesn't seem to be any way around that fact. You can choose to end your existence but other's will pay a price for that. Now that might be justifiable due to them being in such a great amount of pain.

I think that a good way to imagine this is to think of it being two axes. The first one is how much "pain" you are in and the second axis is how much you would prefer to consequence-free not exist at all. A person being tortured for instance would score very highly on the pain axis and also likely very high on the other axis. Our person would score everything from slightly prefer to not exist to really prefer it. And the pain level could in theory be everything from him being in no pain to him being in great pain.
